# Materials for my keynote at PyCon 2014, Montreal

My PyCon 2014 was delivered directly as a collection of IPython notebooks that
included live code and demonstrations, so there's no easy way to turn my talk
into a static PDF.  So I'm sharing all materials here as a Git repository.

To view the notebooks online via nbviewer,
[start with the index](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fperez/pycon2014-keynote/blob/master/Index.ipynb). Note
that some of the notebooks require local code execution to display interactive
widgets.

The entire talk is
[available on video](http://pyvideo.org/video/2683/keynote-fernando-perez), as
part of the complete [PyCon 2014 video series](http://pyvideo.org/category/50/pycon-us-2014).

All notebooks here are a combination of new work and material from previous
presentations not only by me, but also by others in the IPython team and our
broader community. I tried to make sure to provide proper credit everywhere,
please correct me if I missed anything with a Pull request.  Many thanks to
everyone who provided code and examples I could use.
